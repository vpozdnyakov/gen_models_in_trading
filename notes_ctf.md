# Commodity Traiding Firms (CTF)

Commodity Transformation:
* in space - using logistics
* in time - through storage
* in form - with processing

CTFs **undertake physical arbitrage activities**, which involve the simultaneous purchase and sale of a commodity in different forms.

CTFs do **not speculate** on outright commodity price risk, but aim to profit on the differential between the untransformed and transformed commodity.

CTFs specialize in the production and analysis of information that **identifies optimal transformations**. They respond to price signals and invest in physical and human capital to perform these transformations.

# Risk categories

A crucial function of commodity traders is to manage these risks.

**Flat price risk** — the risk of changes in price of commodity. CTFs have little exposure to flat price risk. They normally hedge with derivativies. Hedging exchanges flat price risk for basis risk.

**Basis risk** — the risk of changes in the difference of the price between the commodity being hedged and the hedging instrument.

_For example, the explosion of a natural gas pipeline that dramatically reduced transportation capacity into California caused a massive change in the basis between the price of gas at the California border and at the Henry Hub in Louisiana._

**Spread risk** — the risk to hedge commodity using mismatched in timing hedging instrument.

_For example, a firm may hedge inventory of corn in October using a futures contract that expires in December._

**Margin and Volume Risk** — the risk of variations in margins and volumes of transactions. The risk depend on the kinds of transformations it undertakes, and the assets it utilizes in those transformations. 

_For example, a decline in the demand for a commodity reduces the demand for logistical services provided by commodity trading firms._

**Operational Risk** — result from the failure of some operational process.

_For example, a firm that transports a commodity by sea is at risk to a breakdown that delays completion of a shipment, which often results in financial penalties._

**Contract Performance Risk** — the risk of CTF to the failure of its counterparty to perform within contract commitments.

_For instance, a firm that has entered into contracts to buy a commodity from suppliers and contracts to sell the commodity to consumers can suffer losses when the sellers default._

**Market Liquidity Risk** — the risk to decline of liquidity of markets.

_For example, market stresses can necessitate firms to sell off inventory and liquidate the associated hedges when markets are illiquid and hence their purchases tend to drive prices up and their sales tend to drive prices down._

**Funding Liquidity Risk** — the risk to be deprived of the ability to finance the acquisition of commodities to transport, store, or process.

_For example, shipping a cargo of oil on a very large cruise carrier are heavily leveraged against the security of the value of the commodity._

**Currency Risk** – exchange rate fluctuations.

**Political Risk** — expropriation of assets, bans, changes in contract terms.

**Legal/Reputational Risk** — environmental damage, anti-corruption laws.
