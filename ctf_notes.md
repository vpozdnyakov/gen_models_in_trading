# Commodity Traiding Firms (CTF)

Commodity Transformation:
* in space - using logistics
* in time - through storage
* in form - with processing

CTFs **undertake physical arbitrage activities**, which involve the simultaneous purchase and sale of a commodity in different forms.

CTFs do **not speculate** on outright commodity price risk, but aim to profit on the differential between the untransformed and transformed commodity.

CTFs specialize in the production and analysis of information that **identifies optimal transformations**. They respond to price signals and invest in physical and human capital to perform these transformations.

# Risk categories

A crucial function of commodity traders is to manage these risks.

**Flat price risk** — the risk of changes in price of commodity. CTFs have little exposure to flat price risk. They normally hedge with derivativies. Hedging exchanges flat price risk for basis risk.

**Basis risk** — the risk of changes in the difference of the price between the commodity being hedged and the hedging instrument.

_For example, the explosion of a natural gas pipeline that dramatically reduced transportation capacity into California caused a massive change in the basis between the price of gas at the California border and at the Henry Hub in Louisiana._

**Spread risk** — the risk to hedge commodity using mismatched in timing hedging instrument.

_For example, a firm may hedge inventory of corn in October using a futures contract that expires in December._

**Margin and Volume Risk** — the risk of variations in margins and volumes of transactions. The risk depend on the kinds of transformations it undertakes, and the assets it utilizes in those transformations. 

_For example, a decline in the demand for a commodity reduces the demand for logistical services provided by commodity trading firms._

**Operational Risk** — result from the failure of some operational process.

_For example, a firm that transports a commodity by sea is at risk to a breakdown that delays completion of a shipment, which often results in financial penalties._

**Contract Performance Risk** — the risk of CTF to the failure of its counterparty to perform within contract commitments.

_For instance, a firm that has entered into contracts to buy a commodity from suppliers and contracts to sell the commodity to consumers can suffer losses when the sellers default._

**Market Liquidity Risk** — the risk to decline of liquidity of markets.

_For example, market stresses can necessitate firms to sell off inventory and liquidate the associated hedges when markets are illiquid and hence their purchases tend to drive prices up and their sales tend to drive prices down._

**Funding Liquidity Risk** — the risk to be deprived of the ability to finance the acquisition of commodities to transport, store, or process.

_For example, shipping a cargo of oil on a very large cruise carrier are heavily leveraged against the security of the value of the commodity._

**Currency Risk** – exchange rate fluctuations.

**Political Risk** — expropriation of assets, bans, changes in contract terms.

**Legal/Reputational Risk** — environmental damage, anti-corruption laws.

# Risk Management
To quantify the potential benefits of diversification, I have evaluated data on world trade flows by commodity code.

There are two sets of correlations:
1. Nominal Trade flows — correlations between percentage changes in trade flows across commodities (US)
2. Deflated trade flows — (nominal trade flow in a given year / the nominal price of the commodity), scaled so that the 2001 value is 1.00 (value).

The derived demand for the services of commodity trading firms, and their profitability, is dependent on the quantities of commodities traded, rather than prices. Therefore, the correlations based on deflated data are more relevant for evaluating the potential benefits to the firms of diversification across commodities. The lack of correlation generally, and the prevalence of negative correlations indicate the potential benefits of diversification across commodities in reducing the variability of trading firm risk.

Diversification can reduce a risk.

Integration in the value chain can reduce a risk.

Value-at-Risk (VaR) as a risk measurement tool.

It uses Monte-Carlo simulations to predict P&L outcomes in multiple scenarios.

Trafigura augments its VaR data with stress tests and analysis that estimate P&L outcomes in extreme scenarios.

The company establishes limits on these quantitative risk measures. A team is notified when its measured risk approaches its assigned limit.

Trafigura and other traders operating in this way endeavor to hedge all the risk via futures or swaps, self-finance the initial margins, and also finance any mismatches in variation margin payments.

In addition to hedging inventories, Trafigura also routinely hedges future physical transactions. For instance, it may enter into an agreement to purchase crude from West Africa for delivery in two months at the Brent price plus/minus a differential, and enter into another contract to sell that cargo to a US refiner at the West Texas Intermediate price plus/ minus a differential. This set of transactions exposes the company to fluctuations in the Brent-WTI differential, which it can, and routinely does, hedge by buying Brent futures and selling WTI futures.

# Value-at-Risk

**Value-at-Risk** is defined as the amount of money, or more, that can be lost over a given time horizon with a given probability.

_Implementation of VaR requires the user to choose a probability level, and a time horizon. Consistent with standard industry practice, Trafigura uses a one-day time horizon, and a 95% probability (“confidence”) level. As of 30 September, 2013, Trafigura reported its VaR as $11.3 million. This means that on 95% of trading days, the company would be expected to suffer losses of less than $11.3 million. Put differently, on 5% of trading days, the firm could expect to lose more than $11.3 million._

The company has established a VaR target. Specifically, the firm attempts to maintain VaR at less than 1% of group equity.

This is acceptable for calculating VaR, but as will be discussed in more detail below, it is important for trading companies to understand the likelihood of outcomes that are **more extreme than the VaR**.

That is, it is important to understand what happens in the left tail
of the probability distribution of possible outcomes.

Trafigura uses the heavy-tailed distribution fitted to the portfolio profit and loss simulation outcomes to calculate VaR, and to calculate other measures of risk that focus on extreme losses

The most problematic feature of historical VaR simulations is that the user is a prisoner of the historical data.

Price movements during the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis were far outside anything experienced in the historical data used by firms to calculate VaR at that time.

VaR is increasingly being augmented by **stress tests** that estimate possible losses under extreme scenarios that may not be present in the historical data.

Companies in commodity and financial trading augment VaR with other methods: in particular, methods that quantify how large might be the losses a firm could incur, if the loss is bigger than its VaR.

**Conditional VaR** — the average of losses in excess of VaR.

**Extreme Value Analysis** estimates the probability of more extreme outcomes with losses substantially greater than VaR.

**Procyclicality** — feedback loops between risk evaluation and response to this evaluation.
